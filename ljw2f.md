#Learning Journal Week 2: Friday
Today I learned more about layout in CSS and when to implement each one into a webpage.
I also learned about the debugger in JavaScript and how to use it to find and fix bugs in my code.
I also went and watched the presentations from the 401 classes and got to see what I have in store for me at Code Fellows.
