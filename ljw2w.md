#Learning Journal Week 2: Wed
Today I learned all about forms. With forms we can take data from the user and use JavaScript to take that data and render it to the webpage so the user can see.
I also learned about events in JavaScript, if you want something to happen when the user does a specific action you must use an event listener, which listens for a specific action, and executes code once the event is heard.
